# MEMSandMicrosensors
MEMS and Microsensors is a course taught by Professor Giacomo Langfelder to master students in electronics engineering at Politecnico di Milano.
The course is split in three main sections:
1. MEMS sensors (40%)
    - Building technologies of MEMS and NEMS (Nano Electro Mechanical Systems)
    - Sensing and actuation elements based on capacitive and piezoelectric effects
    - Inertial sensors: accelerometers, gyroscopes
    - Springs configurations
    - MEMS resonators and resonant mass sensors
    - Magnetic field sensors: MEMS, Hall and AMR magnetometers
2. Electronics for MEMS driving and signal acquisition (25%)
    - Low noise/low power fron-end electronics for accelerometers
    - Oscillators and sensing electronics for gyroscopes
    - Amplitude-gain-control (AGC) in oscillators
    - Resonant and off-resonance circuit operations
4. Digital image sensors (35%) 
    - Basics about the interaction of light with semiconductors
    - CMOS-APS pixel detectors
    - General architecture and sensor performances: noise, dynamic range, nonlinearities, frame rate
    - Main acquisition techniques: 4T circuits
    - HDR (High Dynamic Range) architecture

The following notes are a sort of summary about the topics from the building techniques to the magnetometers. Beware: they do not cover all the topics of the course.

PS: there can be several errors, do not take for granted every thing is written in here.
